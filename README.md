# IsaacMacropad
A highly versatile macropad like a "Swiss-army tool" for my computer workflow usable in many different situations such as video editing, 3d modeling, and general system control The macropad will inclide 3x3 or 2x2 key layout and at least one rotary encoder for precise control. This is my first hardware project, and im really exited about it.
